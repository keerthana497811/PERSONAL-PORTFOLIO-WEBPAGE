DESCRIPTION :

This project involves the design and development of a Personal Portfolio Website that showcases my academic background, technical skills, projects, and contact information in a professional and visually appealing manner. The main objective of this project is to create an online platform that represents my profile as an aspiring IT professional and helps me present my skills effectively to recruiters, internship coordinators, and peers.

The website is developed using HTML and CSS, which are core front-end web technologies. HTML is used to structure the content of the website, including sections such as Home, Skills, Projects, and Contact. CSS is used for styling and layout purposes, such as background colors, fonts, alignment, spacing, responsiveness, and hover effects. A clean red-themed background is used to provide a modern and attractive look, while cards and sections are neatly arranged for better readability.

The Home section introduces me with a short professional summary, highlighting my current education status as a second-year B.Tech Information Technology student and my interest in full stack development. The Skills section lists my technical abilities such as HTML, CSS, Git & GitHub, VS Code, and Japanese N4, displayed in a card-based format for clarity. The Projects section briefly explains my personal portfolio project, emphasizing responsive design and structured coding practices. The Contact section provides essential communication details such as email, LinkedIn profile, and GitHub link, allowing viewers to connect with me easily.

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the code editor. VS Code was chosen because of its user-friendly interface, live preview support, extensions, and efficient debugging features. The project was tested using modern web browsers like Google Chrome to ensure proper layout and responsiveness. Version control concepts were followed using Git, and the project can be hosted on platforms such as GitHub Pages for public access.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in front-end web development, including page layout design, responsive styling, navigation linking, and content organization. I also learned how to maintain clean and readable code, use semantic HTML tags, and apply CSS properties effectively for real-world websites.
The application of this project is highly practical. A personal portfolio website is widely used by students, developers, and professionals to showcase their work, skills, and achievements online. It can be used for job applications, internships, freelancing, hackathons, and professional networking. This project demonstrates my ability to design and develop a functional website from scratch and reflects my growing interest in web development.

Overall, this project serves as a strong foundation for my future learning in advanced web technologies such as JavaScript, React, and full stack development.
